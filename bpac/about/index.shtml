                <h2>About Building Pan-Asian Connectivity</h2> 
                <p>The Building Pan-Asian Connectivity Conference is hosted by the U.S. Consulate General-Kolkata, the Center on American and Global Security at Indiana University, and the Observer Research Foundation. A two-day event in Kolkata from March 10th-11th, the conference brings together business, academic, government, and civilian experts from the United States, India, and Southeast Asia to examine the opportunities and obstacles as India and its neighbors take on greater roles in the region. The conference consists of three sessions dedicated to issues in security, the environment, and trade. At the end of the conference, a list of practical recommendations will be presented to key policy makers at the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi.  We are pleased to announce that U.S. Ambassador to India, Richard Verma, will be delivering an  address during the special session on March 11th. Additionally, the conference organizers will publish a compilation of selected papers from our expert panelists centered on the themes of the conference. This conference is generously supported by the U.S. Department of State. </p>

<h3><u>Conference Organizers</h3></u><br />
<p><strong>The Center on American and Global Security (CAGS)</strong> was created within the Indiana University School of Global and International Studies, to enhance and expand the teaching, research, and service mission of the University with respect to the security challenges facing the United States and international relations in the 21st century. As a bridge between the worlds of academic and policy-making security expertise, CAGS creates opportunities for faculty, academic units, and students at Indiana University to interact with, and learn from, leading thinkers and public officials engaged in homeland, national, and global security issues. The center assists faculty members and academic units in developing research projects, courses, conferences, and outreach activities. The 21st century might see the rise of new threats and the return of old ones, but so too will it provide the tools for humanity to meet and conquer these threats. To this end, CAGS works to draw upon our great, shared capacity for reason, knowledge, creativity, and cooperation to better secure both our country and world for current generations and for the generations to come.   </p>

              <p><strong>U.S. Consulate General Kolkata:</strong><br />
 
Kolkata has a preeminent place in the history of American diplomacy as one of the oldest American Consulates anywhere in the world, and the oldest in India. 

President George Washington, on November 19, 1792, nominated Benjamin Joy of Newbury Port as the first American Consul to Kolkata. With the advice of Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson later the third President of the United States and consent of the Senate, President Washington commissioned Joy to that office on November 21, 1792.

Joy, however, reached Kolkata only in April 1794. He was never recognized as Consul by the British East India Company but was permitted to "reside here as a Commercial Agent subject to the Civil and Criminal Jurisdiction of this Country...".

Despite this rather inauspicious beginning, Benjamin Joy's arrival was the beginning of a long official American relationship with Kolkata - and, indeed, with all of India.</p>
 
<p><strong>Public Affairs: </strong><br />

Public Diplomacy complements and reinforces traditional diplomacy by communicating U.S. interests directly to the Indian public and by fostering mutual understanding and building trust between the United States and India. The Public Affairs Section is responsible for press relations, cultural, and educational affairs, and exchange and information activities that articulate U.S. foreign policy and promote greater mutual understanding between India and the United States. The Public Affairs Section in Kolkata also supports the American Library, located in the American Center (38A, J. L. Nehru Road, Kolkata 700071). Information about the United States is readily available here.

As part of its overall program of bilateral cooperation, the Public Affairs Section also has a wide range of academic and professional development exchange programs with India. 

As public interest in, and access to, communications technology continues to grow worldwide, the public dimension of diplomacy is becoming more important than ever. For further information about the United States, its institutions, values, and people, please see the <a href="http://iipdigital.usembassy.gov/#axzz3QbDkAtBY" target="new">"Information USA" section</a>.</p>
