                               <h1><strong>Welcome Note</strong></h1> 
                    <p>Welcome to the website of the Building Pan-Asian Connectivity Conference where you will find pertinent information regarding our schedule of events, a list of our expert panelists, and conference logistics. The Center on American and Global Security is a proud co-sponsor with the Observer Research Foundation which has brought this international conference into fruition with the generous assistance of the Consulate General of the U.S. Kolkata and the U.S. Department of State. Our research unit within Indiana University, Bloomington is dedicated to the study of 21st century security issues facing the United States and the global community that increasingly place political, economic, and social demands on governments, international organizations, private sectors, and communities. The purpose of the Building Pan-Asian Connectivity Conference is to highlight the most recent scholarship on South Asia’s ties to Southeast Asia and East Asia, thus identifying trans-regional issues in the domains of security, counter-terrorism, trade, and environmental affairs.  The scholarly contributions and policy recommendations of our expert panelists, who come from the United States, India, and greater Asia, will be shared with the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi and will culminate in a series of published articles that will undoubtedly impact the approach in which this region is analyzed. Kolkata, the financial hub of eastern India and known as the country’s intellectual and cultural capital, is a germane location for the event as a gateway to India’s eastern neighbors and an essential place of connectivity in the region. The Building Pan-Asian Connectivity Conference has been deemed one of the most important events in the U.S. Diplomatic Mission in India this year and will be Ambassador Richard Verma’s second public visit to Kolkata since assuming his title as Ambassador from the U.S. Department of State. We are also honored to have the participation of U.S. Consul General in Kolkata, Helen LaFave.  </p>
