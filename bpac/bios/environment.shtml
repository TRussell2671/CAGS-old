          <strong>Dr. Jayanta Bandyopadhyay</strong><br />
          
          <em>Professor</em><br />
          <em>Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi</em><br /><br />
         Jayanta Bandyopadhyay was born in Calcutta in 1947. After completing his doctorate in engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, he turned his professional attention to the inter-disciplinary area at the complex interface between the natural environment and human economic activities. The transformation was facilitated by his close interaction with the forest movement in the Indian Himalaya called Chipko. He has been a consistent researcher on various critical policy issues related to environment in Asia, especially the rivers originating in the Himalaya.  His research in the past 25 years has been guided by the objective of generating trans-disciplinary public interest knowledge on critical issues related to the natural environment, and in particular, the hydrosphere. His research formed the basis of important policy changes and court orders on Eucalyptus in social forestry, limestone mining in the Doon Vallya, and limitations of traditional engineering in designing of large water projects on the Himalayan rivers, etc. He was a Coordinating Lead Author in the global report of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment and an expert reviewer for the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change in the area of climate change and water.  He has been the President of the Indian Society for Ecological Economics (2006-8) and a Fellow of the India-China Institute in The New School, New York. He is also an adviser to the Water Diplomacy Program at Tufts University, Medford, USA.  His recent book published by Bloomsbury entitled Environmental Governance has created an important impact in South Asia on how we need to look at nature.</p><br>
