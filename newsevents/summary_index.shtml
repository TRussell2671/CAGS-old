                    <p>On Monday, November 30th, three Indiana University faculty members met to discuss the extending reach of ISIL and the causes for such expansion. In light of the recent attack in Paris, ISIL recruitment and implications become an issue of increasing importance. This panel was organized by the Center on American and Global Security, the Institute for European Studies, and the Center for the Study of the Middle East, and discussed issues ranging from the modernity of ISIL, previous attacks in France and the security dimensions of the attacks.</p>

Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas, Austin. Kuperman argued that recent claims by President Obama in regard to the Iranian nuclear deal were wholly untrue. According to Kuperman, Obama’s claims were unjustified and illogical, making the deal a dangerous endeavor for the United States and its allies.</p>

                    <p>On October 26, the Center on American and Global Security hosted a private event featuring Paul Kapur, Professor in the Department of National Security Affairs at the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School. Dr. Kapur spoke on the topic “Jihad as a Grand Strategy: Islamist Militancy, National Security, and the Pakistani State”. In his lecture, he discussed why a militant proxy strategy could be attractive to a state like Pakistan. Militants are inexpensive and need no basic training, no sophisticated equipment, and no personal support or benefits. However, Dr. Kapur explains that the use of Jihad is a paradox. When a state it weak, it makes militant strategy both useful and dangerous.</p>
