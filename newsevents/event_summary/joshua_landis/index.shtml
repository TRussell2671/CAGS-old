                  <p>In an interview with the Center on American and Global Security, Dr. Joshua Landis from the University of Oklahoma discussed the complex situation in Iraq in Syria today, particularly in regards to ISIS. Dr. Landis spoke to how the US invasion of Iraq in 2003 led to the eventual growth of ISIS, especially as al-Qaeda in Iraq emerged only after Saddam Hussein had been deposed. Furthermore, current leader of ISIS Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was held in Camp Bucca by US forces, where he came into contact with many future leaders of the Islamic State. Many of these individuals had also been Ba’athists in the former Hussein regime, and had held political and military positions before the war.</p>

		  <p>The ISIS ideology was also explained, as it is particularly coherent in its adherence to Salafist jihad, and with establishing a worldwide Islamic caliphate.  In regards to the makeup of the ISIS ranks, Dr. Landis addressed how many of the individuals are foreign fighters, spreading security concerns beyond the region to Central Asia and Europe. Next, Dr. Landis answered the question of whether ISIS poses a threat in the same way al-Qaeda does.  He explained how it does not pose a threat in the same way, as Baghdadi is more concerned with building a caliphate in the region, while al-Qaeda is more focused on attacking the “far enemy” (the United States) more directly.</p>
		  <p>Finally, he explained how ISIS has been able to spread because of state collapses in the region, and how the organization could certainly alter the shape of the Levant area, though with great difficulty due to the separate US and Russian coalitions against them.</p>
