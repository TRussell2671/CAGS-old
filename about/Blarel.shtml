              <h1>Nicolas Blarel</h1>
                    
              <p>Nicolas Blarel is a doctoral student at Indiana University, Bloomington. Prior to joining 
IU, he received a M.A. in Comparative Politics from Sciences-Po in Paris in 2006. Nicolas 
specializes in International Relations, with a more specific focus on security issues in 
South Asia. Nicolas has been particularly analyzing India's relations with the 
Middle-East, and especially with Israel. Nicolas has published his master thesis on 
Indo-Israeli strategic relations (Inde et Israël: le rapprochement stratégique, 
pragmatisme et complémentarité (Paris: L’Harmattan, 2006) and has a forthcoming book on 
this topic: Continuity, Change and Compromise in India’s Foreign Policy: Explaining 
India’s Israel Policy from 1922 to Today. </p>
              <p>Nicolas has 
                equally published book chapters and articles on India's nuclear policies, and more 
                specifically on terrorism and nuclear escalation; India's relations with the U.S.; the 
                evaluation of India’s soft power potential; and India's insurgent movements and 
                state-making. Nicolas has worked for the French Foreign Ministry’s policy planning staff 
                (the Centre d’Analyses et de Prévisions) on questions related to Afghanistan, South Asia, 
                and nuclear proliferation. Nicolas has also been a visiting fellow at the Institute for 
                Defence Studies and Analyses (IDSA) in New Delhi. Last year, he was editorial assistant 
                at the peer-reviewed academic journal, International Studies Quarterly. </p>
