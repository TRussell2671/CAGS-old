                  <p>Ashlyn Anderson is an intern for the Center on American and Global Security. Ashlyn joined the team at the start of 2013 in her last semester as an undergraduate at Indiana University. She earned her degree in English, also minoring in Political Science and Criminal Justice. Her current projects include researching and compiling information on security-related courses at Indiana University to support the proposed certificate program in security studies, creating databases to track grant opportunities, and assisting with logistics for program meetings and for visiting scholars.                  </p>
                  <p> Ashlyn decided to intern with CAGS after developing an interest in security studies as an undergraduate. She is especially interested in South Asia and the legacy of partition in the subcontinent. This summer, she will be traveling to Oxford to complete coursework on international security. In 2011, Ashlyn interned at Eli Lilly in the Department of Government Affairs. She also worked for the IU newspaper in sales during the latter part of her undergraduate education.                  </p>
