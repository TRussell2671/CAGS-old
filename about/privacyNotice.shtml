                  <p>A <a href="https://kb.iu.edu/data/agwm.html">cookie</a> is a small     data file that is written to your hard drive that contains information     about your visit to a web page. If you prefer not to receive cookies,     you may configure your browser not to accept them at all, or to notify     and require approval before accepting new cookies. Some web   pages/sites   may not function properly if the cookies are turned off,   or you may have   to provide the same information each time you visit   those pages.</p>

                  <p>Any other disclosure — with appropriate external parties such   as   law enforcement agencies — will be done in accordance with all     applicable laws and university policies in order to investigate and     respond to suspected violations of law or university policy.</p>
                  <h2>Security</h2>
                  <p>Due to the rapidly evolving nature of information technologies, no     transmission of data over the Internet can be guaranteed to be     completely secure.  While we are committed to protecting the privacy of     our visitors, we cannot guarantee the security of any information that     you transmit to University web sites, and you do so at your own risk.      However, once we receive your information, we will use reasonable     safeguards consistent with prevailing industry standards and     commensurate with the sensitivity of the data being stored to maintain     the security of that information on our systems.</p>
                  <p>In addition, we will comply with all applicable Federal, State and     local laws regarding the privacy and security of visitor information.</p>
