                  <h3>Naxalite Violence</h3>
                  <p>Since 1967, India has incurred thousands of violent  incidents in rural areas conducted by an assortment of Maoist groups known  collectively as the Naxalite movement.  This  movement cites rural poverty and exploitation as motives for its actions, while  critics claim that its followers are truly motivated by the potential profits  to be made off of extortion.  To  investigate the role of economic and social under-development in fueling  Naxalite activity, Professors Sumit Ganguly, Sameeksha Desai, and Arvind Verma  have undertaken a project that will employ Global Information System (GIS)  software to map the types and frequency of Naxalite incidents against local  developmental conditions for the period 2005-2012.<br>

                  <h3>Creative Espionage Operations,  Military Deceptions and Police Stings: Can you Teach Someone To Become More  Creative</h3>
                  <p>This research project, conducted by Professor Gene Coyle, is gathering historical  examples from the espionage, military and police worlds where the operation was  particularly imaginative, and to the extent possible, a look at who were the  people who came up with such ideas.&nbsp; The goal is to see if there is a  common thread among the creators&nbsp;of such creative &quot;scams&quot;, and  finally to look at the question of whether you can teach people to be more  creative than they were at birth.</p>
