                  <h1>Herbert  Scoville Jr. Peace Fellowship</h1>
                    
                  <p>I am pleased to send you information about the Herbert Scoville  Jr. Peace Fellowship, a highly-competitive national program that provides  college and grad school graduates the opportunity to work in Washington, DC,  with one of more than two dozen participating public-interest organizations  focusing on international security issues. The program has awarded 148  fellowships since its inception in 1987 and is offered twice yearly, in the  spring and fall. It lasts from six to nine months and provides a salary, health  insurance, and travel costs to Washington. The Scoville Fellowship does not  award grant or scholarship money to students.<br>
                    <br>
                    Scoville Fellows may undertake a variety of activities, including research,  writing, public education, and advocacy in support of the goals of their host  organization and may attend coalition meetings, policy briefings, and  Congressional hearings. Fellows have written articles, blogs, fact sheets,  letters to the editor, op-eds and reports, organized talks and conferences, and  been interviewed as experts by the media. Former Scoville Fellows work for U.S.  and international NGOs, the Departments of Defense, Energy, State, and  Treasury, members of Congress, academia, and media, and attend graduate school  in political science or international relations, following their fellowships.<br>
  <br>
                    Please encourage those interested in peace and security issues to visit our  website at <a href="http://www.scoville.org/" target="_blank">www.scoville.org</a>.The Scoville Fellowship is a small organization and we lack the resources to  send staff to college career fairs and to post jobs on individual university  websites. Although the majority of Scoville Fellows have received college  degrees in political science, government, international relations, history, or  peace studies, we do not require a specific major. Application requirements are  listed on our website, as are links to the websites of each of the  participating groups and information on the work of current and former Scoville  Fellows. The next application deadline is October 1, 2013 for the spring 2014  fellowship.<br>
  <br>
                    All U.S. citizens, as well as non-U.S. citizens living in the U.S. who have an  appropriate work permit, are eligible to apply; foreign nationals living  outside the United States are not. <br>
  <br>
                    Feel free to contact me with any questions regarding the fellowship.<br>
  <br>
                    Sincerely,<br>
